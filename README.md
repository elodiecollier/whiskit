# 👩‍🍳 Whiskit

**Whiskit** is a personal cookbook app designed to house my favorite recipes, cooking tips, and kitchen basics—all in one well-organized, thoughtfully designed space. It’s built to encourage me to broaden my palate,master fundamental cooking basics, and experiment with new flavors.

This project also serves as a way for me to strengthen and expand my skills in **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and iOS development. I'm using Whiskit as a way to grow both my skills as a developer and a cook—one commit and one recipe at a time.
